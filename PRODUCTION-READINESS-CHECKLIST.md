## ✅ FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION

### Core Features Implemented

1. **Auto-start Recording on MOTION Event** ✅
   - POST /events với type="MOTION"
   - Tự động spawn FFmpeg process
   - Record RTSP stream real-time
   - Lưu vào temp directory cross-platform

2. **Stop Recording và Upload R2** ✅
   - POST /events/:id/end
   - Graceful shutdown FFmpeg (SIGINT)
   - Extract video metadata (duration, size, codec)
   - Upload lên R2 với key: `playbacks/{id}/video.mp4`
   - Update playback với videoUrl, fileSizeBytes, durationSec

3. **Cross-platform Temp Directory** ✅
   ```typescript
   // Windows: C:\Users\{user}\AppData\Local\Temp\playbacks
   // Linux: /tmp/playbacks
   // Override: RECORD_DIR environment variable
   const defaultTempDir = process.platform === 'win32' 
     ? join(process.env.TEMP || process.env.TMP || 'C:\\Windows\\Temp', 'playbacks')
     : '/tmp/playbacks';
   ```

4. **Playback Management API** ✅
   - GET /playbacks - List với filter (eventId, cameraId, recordingStatus)
   - GET /playbacks/:id - Chi tiết playback
   - DELETE /playbacks/:id - Xóa playback + R2 video
   - POST /playbacks/:id/stop - Manual stop recording

5. **Error Handling** ✅
   - FFmpeg process error listener
   - R2 upload retry logic
   - Graceful degradation (event created even if recording fails)
   - Status tracking (PENDING → RECORDING → PROCESSING → COMPLETED/FAILED)

## ⚠️ KNOWN LIMITATIONS & CONSIDERATIONS

### 1. Disk Space Management
**Issue**: Temp files can fill disk if not cleaned up
**Mitigation**:
- Set RECORD_DIR to partition with large space
- Implement auto-cleanup cron job:
  ```bash
  # Delete files older than 1 hour
  find /tmp/recordings -type f -mmin +60 -delete
  ```
- Monitor disk usage with alerts

### 2. Concurrent Recordings
**Issue**: Multiple cameras recording simultaneously → CPU/bandwidth spike
**Current Status**: System supports concurrent recordings
**Monitoring Required**:
- Server CPU usage
- Network bandwidth
- Disk I/O
**Recommendation**: Limit to 5-10 concurrent recordings per server

### 3. R2 Upload Latency
**Issue**: Large videos (>100MB) take minutes to upload
**Current Status**: 
- Upload runs async (doesn't block response)
- Status="PROCESSING" during upload
- Status="COMPLETED" after successful upload
**Acceptable**: Client polls playback status until COMPLETED

### 4. FFmpeg Process Orphaning
**Issue**: If Node.js crashes, FFmpeg processes may remain
**Mitigation**:
- PM2 process manager with auto-restart
- Cleanup orphaned processes on startup:
  ```bash
  # Add to startup script
  pkill -9 -f ffmpeg
  ```

### 5. RTSP Stream Stability
**Issue**: RTSP stream can disconnect, FFmpeg exits unexpectedly
**Current Status**: 
- Error event listener implemented
- Status updated to FAILED if FFmpeg exits with code != 0
**Enhancement Needed**: Retry logic for transient failures

## 📊 PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS

### Recording Specifications

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Video Codec | H.264 (copy mode) | No transcoding, minimal CPU |
| Audio Codec | AAC | Low CPU usage |
| Container | MP4 (faststart) | Web-friendly, seekable |
| Bitrate | Camera native | Typically 2-4 Mbps for 1080p |
| File Size | ~150-300 MB/hour | Depends on camera bitrate |
| CPU Usage | ~5-10% per stream | Copy mode, no encoding |
| Startup Time | 2-3 seconds | FFmpeg spawn + RTSP connect |
| Stop Time | 2-3 seconds | Graceful shutdown + file finalize |

### R2 Upload Speeds

| File Size | Upload Time | Network |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| 50 MB | ~10-20 sec | 20-40 Mbps upload |
| 100 MB | ~20-40 sec | 20-40 Mbps upload |
| 200 MB | ~40-80 sec | 20-40 Mbps upload |

**Note**: Times assume stable network. Production server should have minimum 50 Mbps upload.
